# Employee-Tracker:
This is an employee tracker management app that prompts the user to pick from a few options either to view, add, update or delete data from an employee database.
It is used in the terminal and doesn't require a local server.
The app uses inquirer to prompt the user to interact with the database through the terminal. It also requires mysql2 for the connection.
